# 🐱🐶 Cat vs. Dog Classification Model

This repository contains my third internship task, where I developed a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images of cats and dogs.

## 📂 Project Overview

The main objective is to build a model that accurately classifies images into two categories:
- **Cat** (label = 0)
- **Dog** (label = 1)

### Features
- Data preprocessing: Resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.
- CNN architecture for image classification.
- Performance metrics: Training and validation accuracy and loss.

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cat-vs-dog-classification.git
   cd cat-vs-dog-classification
Install the required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
📝 Usage
Open cat_vs_dog_classification.ipynb in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to train the model and test it on sample images.

Testing the Model
The following images are included for testing:

cat.jpg - Example image of a cat.
cat2.jpg - Another example of a cat.
dog.jpg - Example image of a dog.
📊 Model Performance
Training Accuracy: 96.8%
Validation Accuracy: 83.5%
🚀 Future Work
Improve generalization with data augmentation.
Experiment with transfer learning techniques.
Fine-tune hyperparameters for better results.
